      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I am an extremely inspired web developer. I wrote my first lines of code
        in 2016. Since then, I have learnt many new things and my love for
        programming has only grown. From a young age, I have always believed I
        can do anything I put my mind to and that has fueled me to this very day
        to when writing code. I was immedietly intrigued by software
        development when it was first introduced to me. I absolutely love
        solving problems and I strongly believe that we can solve anything with
        code.
