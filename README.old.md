## About
I am an extremely inspired web developer. I wrote my first lines of code in 2016. Since then, I have learnt many new things and my love for programming has only grown. From a young age, I have always believed I can do anything I put my mind to and that has fueled me to this very day to persue programming. I was immedietly intrigued by software development when it was first introduced to me. I absolutely love solving problems and I strongly believe that we can solve anything with code.
